# Security and Testing Framework

## Contribution Security

### Proposal Framework Integration
```yaml
Contribution Flow:
  1. Proposal Submission:
     - Must follow G-L{level}-{number} format
     - Requires detailed specification
     - Security implications must be documented

  2. Code Review Process:
     - Minimum 2 core contributor reviews
     - Security audit for critical components
     - Automated vulnerability scanning

  3. Testing Requirements:
     - Unit tests required
     - Integration tests for API endpoints
     - Security tests for authentication
```

## Development Environments

### 1. Local Development
```yaml
Environment:
  Name: dev
  Purpose: Individual development
  Access: Local only
  Features:
    - Mock blockchain interactions
    - Simulated XP system
    - Test wallet integration
```

### 2. Sandbox Environment
```yaml
Environment:
  Name: sandbox
  Purpose: Integration testing
  Access: Restricted to verified contributors
  Features:
    - Isolated network
    - Test tokens
    - Simulated governance
  Security:
    - Rate limiting
    - Request validation
    - Access logging
```

### 3. Staging Environment
```yaml
Environment:
  Name: staging
  Purpose: Pre-production testing
  Access: Core team only
  Features:
    - Production-like setup
    - Real network connections
    - Full governance simulation
```

### 4. Production Environment
```yaml
Environment:
  Name: prod
  Purpose: Live system
  Access: Strictly controlled
  Features:
    - Live blockchain
    - Real token economics
    - Full governance
```

## Contribution Tracking

### Code Attribution
```yaml
Git Requirements:
  - Signed commits required
  - GPG key verification
  - Linked to DAO ID

Tracking Metrics:
  - Lines of code
  - Documentation updates
  - Test coverage
  - Security fixes
```

### Smart Contract Deployment
```yaml
Deployment Flow:
  1. Local testing
  2. Sandbox deployment
  3. Security audit
  4. Community review
  5. Governance approval
  6. Production deployment

Security Measures:
  - Multi-sig requirement
  - Timelock for critical changes
  - Emergency pause functionality
```

## Security Measures

### Network Security
```yaml
Protection Layers:
  1. Network Isolation:
     - Separate VPCs per environment
     - Restricted access points
     - VPN requirement for sensitive ops

  2. Access Control:
     - Role-based access (RBAC)
     - Environment-specific permissions
     - Audit logging

  3. Data Protection:
     - Encryption at rest
     - Secure key management
     - Regular security audits
```

### Smart Contract Security
```yaml
Security Protocols:
  1. Code Verification:
     - Automated analysis
     - Manual audits
     - Formal verification

  2. Upgrade Process:
     - Transparent proposals
     - Community review period
     - Gradual rollout

  3. Emergency Response:
     - Circuit breakers
     - Bug bounty program
     - Incident response plan
```

## Testing Framework

### Unit Testing
```yaml
Requirements:
  Coverage: Minimum 85%
  Frameworks:
    - Jest for TypeScript
    - Hardhat for Solidity
    - Pytest for Python
```

### Integration Testing
```yaml
Test Suites:
  API:
    - Endpoint validation
    - Authentication flows
    - Rate limiting

  Smart Contracts:
    - Network interactions
    - Token economics
    - Governance mechanics
```

### Security Testing
```yaml
Security Checks:
  1. Static Analysis:
     - SonarQube
     - Slither
     - ESLint security rules

  2. Dynamic Analysis:
     - Fuzzing tests
     - Penetration testing
     - Stress testing

  3. Compliance:
     - OWASP guidelines
     - Smart contract best practices
     - Data protection standards
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

### System Monitoring
```yaml
Metrics:
  - Network health
  - Smart contract state
  - API performance
  - Security events

Alerts:
  - Unusual activity
  - Performance degradation
  - Security breaches
```

### Response Protocol
```yaml
Severity Levels:
  Critical:
    - Immediate team notification
    - System pause if necessary
    - Emergency response team

  High:
    - Team notification
    - Investigation required
    - Fix within 24 hours

  Medium:
    - Logged and tracked
    - Scheduled fix
    - Regular updates

  Low:
    - Documented
    - Addressed in next sprint
```
