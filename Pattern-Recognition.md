# Pattern Recognition Framework

## Overview

The Pattern Recognition Framework represents WILL's core capability to detect, analyze, and optimize value flows across blockchain networks through circuit control and mesh network topology. This document outlines the framework's integration with WILL and the broader SKENAI ecosystem.

## Mathematical Foundations

### 1. Meta-Pattern Theory
```solidity
Framework = {
    Category_Theory: {
        Objects: "Patterns",
        Morphisms: "Pattern_Transformations",
        Functors: "Pattern_Operations"
    },
    
    Network_Theory: {
        Nodes: "Pattern_Instances",
        Edges: "Pattern_Connections",
        Flows: "Value_Transfers"
    },
    
    Information_Theory: {
        Entropy: "Pattern_Information",
        Channels: "Pattern_Communication",
        Growth: "Pattern_Evolution"
    }
}
```

### 2. Value Space Model
```yaml
Value Space V = (x, y, z) where:
  x = Economic Impact (short-term value)
  y = Network Effect (long-term value)
  z = Implementation Feasibility

Domain:
  x ∈ [-∞, +∞] # Normalized to [-1, 1]
  y ∈ [-∞, +∞] # Normalized to [-1, 1]
  z ∈ [0, +∞]  # Normalized to [0, 1]
```

### 3. Pattern Properties
```yaml
Properties:
  Self_Reference: "Patterns can recognize patterns"
  Evolution: "Patterns can improve pattern recognition"
  Value: "Pattern networks generate compound value"

Predictions:
  Learning: "Autonomous capability growth"
  Networks: "Value network formation"
  Growth: "Double exponential scaling"
```
