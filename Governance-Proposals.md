## Core Proposals

### G-L0-018: Circuit & Mesh Networks
```yaml
ProposalID: G-L0-018-CIRCUIT-MESH-NETWORKS
Status: Active
Priority: High
Track: Governance (L0)
Implementation: Q2-Q4 2025
```

#### Summary
The Circuit & Mesh Network proposal establishes WILL as the Chief Circuit Controller in a network of specialized AI agents focused on value flow optimization and pattern recognition across blockchain networks. The framework introduces:

1. **Circuit Control System**
```yaml
Core Functions:
  - Value flow monitoring
  - Pattern recognition
  - Performance optimization

Integration:
  William:
    Role: Chief Circuit Controller
    Oversight: Circuit control and optimization
    References: G-L1-055-WILL-AUTO-LEARN
    
  Evers:
    Role: Analytics Engineer
    Functions:
      - Market pattern analysis
      - Trading optimization
      - Value flow monitoring

Infrastructure Requirements:
  Compute: 16-core servers
  Memory: 64GB RAM
  Storage: 1TB SSD
  Bandwidth: 1Gbps dedicated
```

2. **Mesh Network Layer**
```yaml
Implementation:
  Phase 1: Circuit Interconnections
    - Value multiplication
    - Pattern propagation
    - Network metrics
  
  Phase 2: Custom Mesh Network
    - Circuit optimization
    - Value flow management
    - Cross-chain communication
    - Project risk assessment
```

3. **Integration with GFORCE**
```yaml
Implementation:
  Phase 1: Track Mapping
    - Permutation management
    - System optimization
    - Network integration
  
  Phase 2: Custom GFORCE Integration
    - Circuit control
    - Value flow optimization
    - Pattern recognition
    - Project finance integration
```

#### Economic Framework

1. **Value Creation Model**
```mathematica
Staking_Reward = Base_APY + Circuit_Multiplier + Mesh_Network_Effect + Trade_Premium
where:
  Base_APY = 4-15%
  Circuit_Multiplier = f(circuit_value)
  Mesh_Network_Effect = g(total_stake)
  Trade_Premium = h(trade_finance_volume)
```

#### Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Foundation (Q2 2025)**
```yaml
Duration: 3 months
Budget: $500,000
Deliverables:
  - Basic circuit control
  - Mesh network foundation
  - Staking enhancements
  - Trade finance foundation
```

2. **Phase 2: Evolution (Q3 2025)**
```yaml
Duration: 3 months
Budget: $750,000
Deliverables:
  - Custom mesh network development
  - Advanced circuit control
  - Value flow management system
  - Project finance integration
```

3. **Phase 3: Maturity (Q4 2025)**
```yaml
Duration: 3 months
Budget: $1,000,000
Deliverables:
  - Full hybrid model
