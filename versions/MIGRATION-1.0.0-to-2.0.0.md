# WILL Research Migration: v1.0.0 to v2.0.0

This guide outlines our research into migrating WILL implementations from v1.0.0 to v2.0.0. All components require thorough validation.

## Research Breaking Changes

### 1. Pipeline API Research
The Pipeline API research investigates the MCP (Market Coordination Protocol) standard:

#### Legacy Research (v1.0.0)
```
/submit    # Under validation
/check     # Requires testing
/status    # Experimental
```

#### Experimental Endpoints (v2.0.0)
```
/pipeline/submit    # Research entry point
/pipeline/validate # Theoretical validation
/pipeline/analyze  # Experimental efficiency (Q.1)
/pipeline/patterns # Research recognition (Q.2)
/pipeline/status   # Research state tracking
/pipeline/vote     # Theoretical governance
```

### 2. NATURAL Framework Research
The NATURAL Framework research requires validation:

1. Research Repository Structure:
   - Public API Research (WILL)
   - Private Validator Studies (SKENAI-R)
   - Pattern Analysis Research (SKENAI-Q)

2. Research Pipeline Flow:
   ```
   SKENAI Research > R-proposal Study > Q.1 Analysis > Q.2 Research > Vote Study > R-final Research
   ```

### 3. Security Research Updates
- R validator research framework
- Vote gate validation studies
- Core validator research model
- Pattern emergence studies

## Research Features

### 1. Three-Graph Research
- Technical Graph Studies (LEGEND)
- Economic Graph Research
- Quality Graph Analysis
- Cross-graph Research Methods

### 2. WillChat Research
- Language interface studies
- Pattern response research
- Integration validation methods

### 3. XP Research System
- Experience tracking studies
- Validator research metrics
- Quality analysis framework

## Research Migration Path

1. API Research Updates:
   - Endpoint validation studies
   - Format research methods
   - Validation research framework

2. NATURAL Research Implementation:
   ```
   research-implementation/
   ├── public/         # WILL research interface
   ├── private/        # Core research validators
   └── quality/        # Pattern research analysis
   ```

3. Security Research:
   - Vote gate validation
   - R validator studies
   - Policy research framework

4. Feature Research:
   - Three-Graph validation
   - WillChat research (experimental)
   - XP system studies

## Research Verification

- [ ] API research validation
- [ ] NATURAL framework studies
- [ ] Security model research
- [ ] Three-Graph experiments

## A Note to Our Family

While maintaining our rigorous research foundation, we recognize that William's strength comes from bringing people together. As a family-focused business, we:
- Value research integrity
- Share verified insights
- Support each other's growth
- Build trust through honesty
- Win through excellence

Remember: While we operate as a family business, our foundation is built on rigorous research and validation. Every feature and capability represents ongoing research that requires thorough testing before practical implementation.
