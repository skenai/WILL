# Version Badge Template

## For v2.0.0 Documents
```markdown
> **Version Notice**: This documentation is for WILL v2.0.0. For older versions:
> - [v1.0.0 Documentation](https://github.com/shibakery/WILL/tree/v1.0.0/versions/v1.0.0)
```

## For v1.0.0 Documents
```markdown
> **Version Notice**: This is archived documentation for WILL v1.0.0. 
> For the latest version, see [current documentation](https://github.com/shibakery/WILL/wiki).
```

## Usage Guidelines
1. Add badges immediately after the title
2. Include version notice after badges
3. Link to both current and archived versions
4. Use consistent badge colors:
   - Blue: Version number
   - Green: Current docs
   - Yellow: Archived docs
