## A Note to Our Family

While maintaining our rigorous research foundation, we recognize that William's strength comes from bringing people together. As a family-focused business, we:
- Value research integrity
- Share verified insights
- Support each other's growth
- Build trust through honesty
- Win through excellence

Remember: While we operate as a family business, our foundation is built on rigorous research and validation. Every social feature and Farcaster integration represents ongoing research that requires thorough testing before practical implementation.
