# Health Check System

## Overview
The Health Check System is a critical component that ensures WILL's reliable operation within the SKENAI ecosystem. It monitors core services, API integrations, and system performance to maintain optimal functionality.

## Core Components

### 1. GitHub Integration Health
- API status monitoring
- Rate limit tracking
- Installation validation
- Token verification

### 2. System Status Endpoints
- `/api/health`: Core health status
  - Aggregated system health
  - Individual component status
  - Performance metrics
  - Rate limit information

### 3. Health Service Architecture
```typescript
interface HealthStatus {
  status: 'healthy' | 'degraded' | 'unhealthy';
  details: string;
  timestamp: number;
}
```

## Integration with WILL

### 1. Automated Response
WILL uses health check data to:
- Adjust request rates
- Route through alternative paths
- Alert system administrators
- Log performance patterns

### 2. Pattern Recognition
Health metrics feed into WILL's pattern recognition system:
- Temporal usage patterns
- System load correlation
- Error frequency analysis
- Performance optimization

### 3. Circuit Protection
Health checks help WILL manage Circuit & Mesh operations:
- Load balancing
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Mesh network routing
- Value flow optimization

## Best Practices

### 1. Monitoring
- Regular status checks
- Alert thresholds
- Response time tracking
- Error rate monitoring

### 2. Maintenance
- Proactive rate limit management
- Regular token rotation
- Cache optimization
- Performance tuning

### 3. Development
- Test coverage
- Error handling
- Timeout configuration
- Fallback strategies
