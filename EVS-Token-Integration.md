# EVS Token Integration

## Overview

The EVS token is deeply integrated into WILL's ecosystem as our first strategic token partnership. This document details the technical implementation and features of the EVS token integration.

## Token Details

- **Name**: Everstrike Token
- **Symbol**: EVS
- **Contract**: [Address to be added]
- **Chain**: [Chain to be added]

## Integration Points

### 1. Smart Contract Integration

```solidity
interface IEverstrikeIntegration {
    // DEX Integration
    function getDEXInfo() external view returns (
        address router,
        address factory,
        address treasury
    );
    
    function getPoolInfo(address token0, address token1) external view returns (
        address pool,
        uint256 reserve0,
        uint256 reserve1,
        uint256 totalSupply
    );
}
```

### 2. Liquidity Management

- Natural market making through NORBERT framework
- Brownian motion-based liquidity provision
- Cybernetic feedback control systems
- Real-time pattern recognition and adaptation
- Performance monitoring through energy landscapes

### 3. Governance Integration

- Cross-DAO voting rights
- Proposal creation and execution
- Community feedback mechanisms
- AI-powered governance analysis

## Features

### For EVS Token Holders

1. **Enhanced Liquidity**
   - Natural market making via NORBERT
   - Emergent price discovery patterns
   - Self-optimizing liquidity pools
   - Energy-minimizing trade paths

2. **Governance Rights**

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contracts

1. **Core Integration**
```solidity
contract EverstrikeIntegration is IEverstrikeIntegration {
    // Core integration logic
    // Market making parameters
    // Governance bridge
    // Community feedback
}
```

2. **Governance Bridge**
```solidity
contract GovernanceBridge {
    // Cross-DAO proposal management
    // Voting power calculation
    // Proposal execution
    // Community feedback
}
```

### AI Components
