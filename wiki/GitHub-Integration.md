# GitHub Integration Research

## Research Overview

Our research investigates theoretical approaches to GitHub integration for proposal management, version control, and collaboration features. All components require thorough testing before practical implementation. This research is fundamental to studying how WILL could potentially track, analyze, and manage research proposals within the SKENAI ecosystem.

## Core Research Components

### 1. API Integration Research
- Authentication methodology studies
- Rate limit management research
- Error handling framework
- Request optimization studies
- Implementation validation

### 2. Proposal Management Research
```typescript
// Theoretical proposal interface pending validation
interface ProposalResearch {
  title: string;
  content: string;
  metadata: {
    track: string;
    xpValue: number;
    status: 'research' | 'review' | 'validation';
  };
}
```

## A Note to Our Family

While maintaining our rigorous research foundation, we recognize that William's strength comes from bringing people together. As a family-focused business, we:
- Value research integrity
- Share verified insights
- Support each other's growth
- Build trust through honesty
- Win through excellence

Remember: While we operate as a family business, our foundation is built on rigorous research and validation. Every feature and capability represents ongoing research that requires thorough testing before practical implementation.
