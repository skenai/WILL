# WILL API Research Documentation

## Research Implementation Notes

1. **Research Validation Requirements**
   - All endpoints require thorough validation
   - System capabilities need extensive testing
   - Performance metrics are theoretical targets
   - Results require scientific verification
   - Integration patterns need testing

2. **Research Methodology**
   - Rigorous scientific approach
   - Theoretical framework validation
   - Experimental testing protocols
   - Performance measurement studies
   - Results verification methods

## Research Overview
The WILL API represents an experimental research interface for programmatic access to the SKENAI ecosystem research project. All features, capabilities, and integrations described here require thorough validation through our research framework.

## Authentication Research Framework
```typescript
// Experimental Authentication Research Model
const willResearch = new WILLStudy({
  researchKey: 'your-research-key',  // Research validation key
  studyEnvironment: 'research'       // Research environment
});
```

## Core Research Endpoints

### 1. Value Analysis Research Framework
```typescript
// Theoretical Value Analysis Research
POST /api/v1/value/research
{
  "economic_study": 0.5,     // Research metric
  "network_analysis": 0.7,   // Experimental value
  "feasibility_research": 0.9 // Theoretical assessment
}
```

### 2. Pattern Recognition Research Framework
```typescript
// Experimental Pattern Research
POST /api/v1/patterns/research
{
  "study_timeframe": "7d",        // Research period
  "validation_confidence": 0.8    // Theoretical threshold
}
```

### 3. Proposal Research Management
```typescript
// Theoretical Proposal Research
POST /api/v1/proposals/study
{
  "research_track": "G",           // Research track
  "study_level": "L0",            // Theoretical level
  "research_title": "Research Study"
}
```

## Mathematical Research Framework

### 1. Value Space Research Model
```typescript
// Theoretical Value Research Space
interface ValueResearch {
  economic_study: number;    // [-1, 1] Research range
  network_analysis: number;  // [-1, 1] Experimental metric
  feasibility_test: number;  // [0, 1] Theoretical assessment
}
```

### 2. Pattern Analysis Research Model
```typescript
// Theoretical Pattern Research Model
interface PatternStudy {
  research_type: string;
  study_confidence: number;
  impact_analysis: ValueResearch;
  research_relationships: string[];
}
```

### 3. Track Research Management
```typescript
// Theoretical Track Research Model
interface TrackStudy {
  research_track: 'G' | 'F' | 'O' | 'R' | 'C' | 'E';
  study_level: 'L0' | 'L1' | 'L2' | 'L3';
  research_value: ValueResearch;
}
```

## SDK Research Framework

### 1. Research Installation
```bash
# Research SDK Package Installation
npm install @skenai/will-research-sdk
```

### 2. Research Implementation Example
```typescript
// Theoretical Research Implementation
import { WILLResearch } from '@skenai/will-research-sdk';

const willStudy = new WILLResearch({
  researchKey: 'your-research-key',  // Research credentials
  studyEnvironment: 'research'       // Research environment
});

// Experimental Research Proposal
const researchProposal = await willStudy.createResearch({
  research_track: 'G',           // Research track
  study_level: 'L0',            // Theoretical level
  research_title: 'Research Study'
});
```

### 3. Advanced Research Studies
```typescript
// Experimental Pattern Research
const patternStudies = await willStudy.analyzePatterns({
  research_timeframe: '7d'
});

// Theoretical Value Research
const valueStudy = await willStudy.calculateResearchValue({
  economic_study: 0.5,
  network_analysis: 0.7,
  feasibility_research: 0.9
});
```

## Research Implementation Requirements

1. **Theoretical Validation**
   - All endpoints require research validation
   - Authentication methods need experimental testing
   - Rate limits are under research study
   - Error handling requires verification protocols
   - SDK features need thorough validation studies

## Rate Limits Research Framework
- 1000 research requests/minute (standard tier)
- 5000 research requests/minute (premium tier)
- Custom research limits available for study

## Error Research Framework
```typescript
try {
  const researchResult = await willStudy.conductResearch();
} catch (researchError) {
  if (researchError.code === 'RESEARCH_LIMIT_EXCEEDED') {
    // Handle research rate limiting
  }
}
```
