### 3. API Research Implementation
```typescript
// Experimental Edge API Research
export const runtime = 'edge';

/**
 * RESEARCH NOTICE: This function implements a theoretical
 * edge runtime model that requires thorough validation.
 * 
 * Research Validation Requirements:
 * 1. Edge processing needs verification
 * 2. Response handling requires testing
 * 3. Performance metrics need validation
 * 4. Error handling needs research
