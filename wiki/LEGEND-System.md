All features, components, and capabilities discussed here are research objectives that require extensive testing and validation. All system architectures, validation methods, and implementation approaches are proposed models pending practical implementation.

# LEGEND System Research

The LEGEND (Lattice-Enabled Graph ENgine for Decisions) System research project investigates technical validation approaches within WILL's theoretical Three-Graph Lattice framework. All components require thorough validation.

## Research Components

### 1. Technical Graph Research
- Code validation studies
- Security research framework
- Dependency research model
- Performance study metrics

### 2. Pattern Engine Research
- Pattern detection studies
- Code similarity research
- Security vulnerability research
- Quality metrics framework

### 3. Decision Engine Research
- Technical validation studies
- Security policy research
- Resource research model
- Performance study framework

## Research Integration Points

### Three-Graph Lattice Research
LEGEND research explores Technical Graph integration:
1. Technical validation studies
2. Graph communication research
3. Standards research framework
4. System integrity studies

### NATURAL Research Framework
LEGEND investigates NATURAL principles through:
1. Repository Research Separation
   - Public API Research (WILL)
   - Private Validator Studies (SKENAI-R)
   - Pattern Analysis Research (SKENAI-Q)

2. Pipeline Research Flow:
   ```
   SKENAI Research > R-proposal Study > Q.1 Analysis > Q.2 Research > Vote Study > R-final Research
   ```

3. Validator Research Protection:
   - Core validator research
   - Vote gate studies
   - Pattern research preservation

## Research Implementation

### 1. Pattern Detection Research
```python
# Research Notice: This code represents a theoretical implementation
# that requires thorough validation and testing.

from will.legend import PatternEngine

# Experimental pattern detection
engine = PatternEngine(research_mode=True)
patterns = engine.detect_patterns(code_block, validate=True)
validation = engine.validate_patterns(patterns, research=True)
```

### 2. Security Validation Research
```python
# Research Notice: This code represents a theoretical implementation
# that requires thorough validation and testing.

from will.legend import SecurityValidator

# Experimental security validation
validator = SecurityValidator(research_mode=True)
security_check = validator.analyze(code_block, validate=True)
recommendations = validator.get_recommendations(research=True)
```

### 3. Quality Metrics Research
```python
# Research Notice: This code represents a theoretical implementation
# that requires thorough validation and testing.

from will.legend import QualityMetrics

# Experimental quality assessment
metrics = QualityMetrics(research_mode=True)
score = metrics.calculate(code_block, validate=True)
improvements = metrics.suggest_improvements(research=True)
```

## Pipeline Research Integration

### 1. Technical Validation Research
```typescript
// Research Notice: This API represents a theoretical implementation
// that requires thorough validation and testing.

POST /pipeline/validate
{
    "proposal_id": string,
    "validation_type": "technical",
    "research_mode": true
}
```

### 2. Pattern Analysis Research
```typescript
// Research Notice: This API represents a theoretical implementation
// that requires thorough validation and testing.

POST /pipeline/analyze
{
    "proposal_id": string,
    "analysis_type": "technical",
    "research_mode": true
}
```
