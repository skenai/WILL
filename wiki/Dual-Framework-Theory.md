# SKENAI: The Camera Framework Research Project

## Research Abstract

Our research investigates SKENAI's theoretical function as a sophisticated lens for observing, understanding, and working with value flows. This research proposes that, like a camera, the system could potentially capture reality without distorting it, enabling clear vision of patterns, networks, and opportunities. All capabilities require thorough validation.
