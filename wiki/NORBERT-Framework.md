# NORBERT Natural Systems Research Framework

## Research Overview

NORBERT represents our theoretical research into natural systems that combines Brownian motion principles with Norbert Wiener's cybernetic control theory. This research investigates efficient, emergent behavior in the SKENAI ecosystem through natural movement patterns and information-guided control systems.

- Natural exploration research
- Pattern formation analysis
- Computational efficiency research

### 2. Information Control Research (Wiener)
- Behavior guidance studies
- Cybernetic feedback research
- System adaptation analysis
- Natural optimization research

### 3. Energy Landscape Research
- Topology research framework
- Information flow studies
- Token distribution analysis
- Quantum-inspired research

## Research Implementation

### Energy Landscape Research
The energy landscape research investigates system topology and information flows:
```python
class EnergyLandscape:
    def __init__(self):
        """

        research models requiring thorough validation.
        """
        self.topology = {
            'wells': [],      # Theoretical stable states
            'barriers': [],   # Research energy costs
            'gradients': []   # Experimental direction hints
        }
        self.information = {
            'signals': [],    # Research feedback
            'flows': [],      # Theoretical movements

        }
```

### Natural Agent Research
Research into agent behavior combining random walks with information guidance:
```python
class NaturalAgent:
    def step(self):
        """
        RESEARCH NOTICE: This method implements theoretical
        research models requiring thorough validation.
        """
        # Brown's random walk research (70%)
        random_step = self.brownian_motion()
        
        # Wiener's information guidance studies (30%)
        info_gradient = self.get_local_information()
        
        # Combined movement research
        return self.move(
            random_step * 0.7 +
