# EVS Token Integration Research Project

> **IMPORTANT RESEARCH NOTICE**: This documentation describes a theoretical research project under active development. All integrations, features, and capabilities discussed here are research objectives that require extensive testing and validation. Token integration patterns, market making approaches, and governance systems are proposed models pending practical implementation.

## Research Overview

Our research investigates the potential integration of the EVS token into WILL's theoretical ecosystem as our first strategic token partnership study. This document outlines our research into the technical implementation and proposed features of the EVS token integration framework.

## Token Research Details

- **Name**: Everstrike Token Research Project
- **Symbol**: EVS
- **Contract**: [Research implementation pending]
- **Chain**: [Research implementation pending]

## Research Integration Points

### 1. Smart Contract Research Framework

```solidity
// RESEARCH NOTICE: This interface represents a theoretical model
// requiring thorough validation and testing
interface IEverstrikeResearch {
    // DEX Research Integration
    function getResearchDEXInfo() external view returns (
        address router,
        address factory,
        address treasury
    );
    
    function getResearchPoolInfo(address token0, address token1) external view returns (
        address pool,
        uint256 reserve0,
        uint256 reserve1,
        uint256 totalSupply
    );
}
```
