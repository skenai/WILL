# Pattern Recognition Framework

> **IMPORTANT RESEARCH NOTICE**: The Pattern Recognition Framework represents a theoretical research project under active development. All features, metrics, and capabilities discussed in this documentation are research objectives that require extensive testing and validation. All pattern detection, analysis methods, and system behaviors are proposed models pending practical implementation.

## Research Overview

The Pattern Recognition Framework investigates theoretical approaches for detecting, analyzing, and optimizing value flows across blockchain networks through experimental circuit control and mesh network topology research. This document outlines the framework's theoretical integration with WILL and the broader SKENAI research ecosystem.

## Theoretical Mathematical Foundations

  x = Economic Impact (theoretical short-term value)
  y = Network Effect (experimental long-term value)
  z = Implementation Feasibility (research metric)

Research Domain:
  x ∈ [-∞, +∞] # Theoretical normalization to [-1, 1]
  y ∈ [-∞, +∞] # Experimental normalization to [-1, 1]
  z ∈ [0, +∞]  # Research normalization to [0, 1]
```
