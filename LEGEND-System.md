# LEGEND System

The LEGEND (Lattice-Enabled Graph ENgine for Decisions) System is the technical validation component of WILL's Three-Graph Lattice.

## Core Components

### 1. Technical Graph
- Code validation
- Security checks
- Dependency management
- Performance monitoring

### 2. Pattern Engine
- Pattern detection
- Code similarity analysis
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Quality metrics calculation

### 3. Decision Engine
- Technical validation decisions
- Security policy enforcement
- Resource optimization
- Performance tuning

## Integration Points

### Three-Graph Lattice
LEGEND serves as the Technical Graph in the Three-Graph Lattice:
1. Validates technical aspects of proposals
2. Communicates with Economic and Quality graphs
3. Enforces technical standards
4. Maintains system integrity

### NATURAL Framework
LEGEND implements NATURAL principles through:
1. Clean repository separation
   - Public API (WILL)
   - Private validators (SKENAI-R)
   - Pattern analysis (SKENAI-Q)

2. Natural pipeline flow:
   ```
   SKENAI > R-proposal > Q.1 > Q.2 > vote > R-final
   ```

3. Validator protection:
   - Core validators remain private
   - Vote gates for major changes
   - Pattern emergence preserved

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Pattern Detection
```python
from will.legend import PatternEngine

engine = PatternEngine()
patterns = engine.detect_patterns(code_block)
validation = engine.validate_patterns(patterns)
```

### 2. Security Validation
```python
from will.legend import SecurityValidator

validator = SecurityValidator()
security_check = validator.analyze(code_block)
recommendations = validator.get_recommendations()
```

### 3. Quality Metrics
```python
from will.legend import QualityMetrics

metrics = QualityMetrics()
score = metrics.calculate(code_block)
improvements = metrics.suggest_improvements()
```

## Pipeline Integration

### 1. Technical Validation
```typescript
POST /pipeline/validate
{
    "proposal_id": string,
    "validation_type": "technical"
}
```

### 2. Pattern Analysis
```typescript
POST /pipeline/analyze
{
    "proposal_id": string,
    "analysis_type": "technical"
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Technical Validation
   - Always validate code quality
   - Check security implications
   - Monitor performance impact
   - Verify dependencies

2. Pattern Management
   - Document detected patterns
   - Track pattern evolution
   - Monitor pattern health
   - Update pattern rules

3. Security
   - Regular security scans
   - Dependency updates
   - Access control
   - Audit logging

## Version Changes

### New in v2.0.0
1. Three-Graph Lattice integration
2. NATURAL Framework compliance
3. Enhanced pattern detection
4. Improved security validation
5. Real-time quality metrics

### Migration Notes
- Update to new API endpoints
- Implement pattern detection
- Enable Three-Graph validation
- Add security enhancements
