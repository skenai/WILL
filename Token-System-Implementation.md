# Token System Research Framework

> **IMPORTANT RESEARCH NOTICE**: This document outlines a theoretical research project under active development. All components, metrics, and capabilities discussed here are research objectives that require extensive testing and validation. All token systems, interactions, and behaviors are proposed models pending practical implementation.

## Research Overview
This document investigates theoretical token system models for managing value distribution, rewards, and interactions within the SKENAI research ecosystem. All features and implementations described here require thorough validation through extensive research and testing.

## Core Research Components

### 1. Token Type Research
```typescript
// Research Notice: These interfaces represent theoretical models
// requiring thorough validation before practical implementation
interface TokenTypeResearch {
  SHIBAK: 'Research Platform Token';
  SBX: 'Research Governance Token';
  BSTBL: 'Research Stablecoin';
  SBV: 'Research Value Token';
  EVS: 'Research Everstrike Token';
}

interface TokenMetricsResearch {
  supply: number;    // Theoretical supply target
  circulation: number; // Research circulation model
  locked: number;    // Theoretical lock mechanism
  burned: number;    // Research burn tracking
}
```

### 2. XP System Research Integration
```typescript
// Research Notice: This interface represents a theoretical model
// requiring thorough validation before practical implementation
interface XPRewardResearch {
  track: string;
  amount: number;
  multiplier: number;
  tokens: {
    type: keyof TokenTypeResearch;
    amount: number;
  }[];
}
```
