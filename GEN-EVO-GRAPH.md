# GRAPH: Network Topology

## Core Concepts
- Emergent network structure
- Dynamic connection strength
- Natural clustering
- Adaptive topology

## Key Features
1. **Dynamic Connections**
   - Strength based on usage
   - Natural path formation
   - Automatic pruning

2. **Cluster Formation**
   - Natural group emergence
   - Value-based clustering
   - Efficiency optimization

3. **Network Health**
   - Connection monitoring
   - Performance metrics
   - Topology optimization

## Integration Points
- FLOW: Value path optimization
- AIQ: Connection quality metrics
- Economic incentive alignment

## References
- Implementation: 1-G-L1-116-GRAPH
