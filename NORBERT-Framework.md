# NORBERT Natural Systems Framework

## Overview

NORBERT is a natural systems framework that combines Brownian motion principles with Norbert Wiener's cybernetic control theory. It enables efficient, emergent behavior in the SKENAI ecosystem through natural movement patterns and information-guided control systems.

## Core Components

### 1. Natural Movement (Brown)
- Agents behave as particles in Brownian motion
- Natural exploration of state space
- Emergent pattern formation
- Minimal computational overhead

### 2. Information Control (Wiener)
- Behavior guidance through information fields
- Cybernetic feedback loops
- System learning and adaptation
- Natural optimization processes

### 3. Energy Landscape
- Topology management (wells, barriers, gradients)
- Information flow control
- SHIBAK token distribution alignment
- Quantum-inspired state management

## Technical Implementation

### Energy Landscape
The energy landscape manages system topology and information flows:
```python
class EnergyLandscape:
    def __init__(self):
        self.topology = {
            'wells': [],      # Stable states
            'barriers': [],   # Energy costs
            'gradients': []   # Direction hints
        }
        self.information = {
            'signals': [],    # Cybernetic feedback
            'flows': [],      # Value movements
            'patterns': []    # Emergent behaviors
        }
```

### Natural Agent Behavior
Agents combine random walks with information guidance:
```python
class NaturalAgent:
    def step(self):
        # Brown's random walk (70%)
        random_step = self.brownian_motion()
        
        # Wiener's information guidance (30%)
        info_gradient = self.get_local_information()
        
        # Combined movement
        return self.move(
            random_step * 0.7 +
            info_gradient * 0.3
        )
```
