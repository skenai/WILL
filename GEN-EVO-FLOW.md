# FLOW: Natural Value Distribution

## Core Concepts
- Dynamic path discovery
- Value flow optimization
- Adaptive routing mechanics
- Real-time adjustment

## Key Components
1. **Flow Detection**
   - Usage pattern analysis
   - Value concentration tracking
   - Network bottleneck identification

2. **Path Optimization**
   - Dynamic route discovery
   - Efficiency maximization
   - Congestion avoidance

3. **Adaptation System**
   - Real-time flow adjustment
   - Load balancing
   - Performance optimization

## Integration Points
- GRAPH: Network topology awareness
- AIQ: Quality-based routing decisions
- Economic incentives alignment

## References
- Implementation: 1-G-L1-115-FLOW
