# SKENAI XP and Pattern Recognition System

## Overview

The SKENAI ecosystem uses Experience Points (XP) as both an incentive mechanism and a measurement tool. This dual nature allows us to drive community growth while understanding value flows within the system.

## XP Core System

### Track Multipliers (GFORCE)
1. **Genesis (G) Track** - Core system development
   - Base multiplier: 1.0x
   - Focus: Foundation proposals
   - Base XP: 2000 per proposal
   - Pattern Value: System foundation patterns

2. **Fractal (F) Track** - Scaling and expansion
   - Base multiplier: 1.5x
   - Focus: System scaling
   - Base XP: 3000 per proposal
   - Pattern Value: Growth patterns

3. **Operations (O) Track** - System operations
   - Base multiplier: 1.2x
   - Focus: Implementation
   - Base XP: 2400 per proposal
   - Pattern Value: Operational flows

4. **Research (R) Track** - Investigation and analysis
   - Base multiplier: 2.0x
   - Focus: Innovation
   - Base XP: 4000 per proposal
   - Pattern Value: Discovery patterns

5. **Community (C) Track** - User-focused initiatives
   - Base multiplier: 1.8x
   - Focus: Engagement
   - Base XP: 3600 per proposal
   - Pattern Value: Network patterns

6. **Evolution (E) Track** - System improvements
   - Base multiplier: 1.5x
   - Focus: Advancement
   - Base XP: 3000 per proposal
   - Pattern Value: Enhancement patterns
